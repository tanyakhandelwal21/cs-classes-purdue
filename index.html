                    <p>
                        CS 180 is a class based on object-oriented programming in Java. It goes from the very basics of Java to developing GUIs in Java. It is easy for the people coming in with some programming experience, however, can be challenging for people who have minimal or no programming experience.

                    <p>
                        CS 240 introduces the UNIX command environment and coding in C. Students learn about memory management, working with pointers, and low-level I/O. The good thing about this class is that it involves no theory, all exams and homework assignments focus on writing code to solve a problem.

                        CS 250 delves into hardware. Students learn about how computers are built from the very lowest level. Lab assignments involve making circuits and writing assembly code on a Rasberry Pi. The exams get very tricky.
